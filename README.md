# columnizeR

A small package for rendering equal width dual columns.

## Rationale

I ended up doing a lot of dual column layouts for seminars, teaching etc that I wanted to knit into powerpoint, HTML, and beamer presentations.
I got frustrated doing it manually each time.
So I wrote this.
Hopefully you (whoever you are) find it useful too.
