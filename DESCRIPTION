Title: Utilties for Creating Column Output Using Knitr 
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Daniel J. Finnegan
Maintainer: Daniel J. Finnegan <finnegand@cardiff.ac.uk>
Description: This package contains utility functions for specifying dual column output in RMarkdown files.
    I wrote it to ease the pain of creating columns across HTML, Beamer, and PowerPoint presentations.
    One creates two Rmd files, one for the left column and one for the right, then call the dual.column function to 
    automatically render 2 columns of equal width irrespective of the rendered output
    The intention is that dual.column is called inside r chunks in Rmd files.
    The function will then populate the generated md file with the correct template corresponding to the current
    output format specified.
